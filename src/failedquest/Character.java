 * Failed Quest
 * File: Character.java
 *
 *  This object class will store all of the data that any character, mob, or
 *	boss in the game will contain. This class will posses several variables
 *	such as name, attack, ranged attack. The class will also contain an 
 *      array that contains status affects placed on the character. By not
 *      having an array instead of an enum, the character can have multiple
 *      status effects. Enemy mobs will be generated from this same class. By
 *      having everything have the same variables, it will become easier to
 *      program interactions between objects. Will have an array to store that
 *      playerâ€™s items.
